        <ul>
            <li>Completed a lab where the instructions were to set up a User's account in Active directory. A premade group was there for
                me to use I went to the groups folder and there were fake employees already in there I needed to just right-click on the
                blank space and press new then user from there I added the users name login and the domain I then set the temporary password and pressed change password on login. The user was created successfully from the test I did on the other VM
                that was provided.
            </li>
            <br>
                
            <li>
                I completed a lab where a system administrator wanted to check the latest failed logins on a Linux system I was able to use
                the sudo tail /var/log/auth.log | grep failed login I was able to read in that log the newest attempts of failed logins in that
                lab. It taught me how to read logs in Linux and understand how they are used to attempt to spot a suspected
                dictionary/brute force attack.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Completed a lab in Windows Active directory where I had to set a group policy to have a password enforcement policy for a
                companies Domain I was able to navigate over to the Domain policy section and set a password length, password expiry
                date and enforce password history so the same password is not used again. I tested the policy by using the other VM
                provided and had a new account set up. I tried not following the policy and I was unable to change the password. I then
                followed the rules I had set and the new password worked.

    <h2 align="center">Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discord bot(2024): Created a bot that gives a user their stats when a slash command is used <a href="https://github.com/EthaGarz/Ethan-Garza-Portfolio/blob/main/faceit_bot.py" target="_blank"><br><img src="./images/resume stuff.gif" height="300"></a>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                A personal project for work where I used Python and pandas to compare an excel file from an
                audit to a previous excel file that was already made with all of our equipment, I used our audit file and the equipment file
                to find “lost radios” by using operators, variables and pandas dataframe.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Resume Website Deployed with Azure(2023): I successfully completed a project where I created a personal static resume
                website using a pre-designed template. The deployment involved using Azure services, including CosmosDB, Function App,
                Storage Accounts, and a Content Delivery Network (CDN). While customizing the template to add an API for a visitor
                counter, I encountered challenges due to the outdated video tutorial. These challenges required me to engage in extensive
                troubleshooting and self-learning to adapt the code to current Azure functions. In addition, I effectively used Visual Studio
                Code and Git for version control, applying 'git add -A' and 'git commit -m' to manage updates and comments in my GitHub
                repository. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in overcoming technical hurdles, working with website
                templates, configuring cloud services, and employing Git for version control.
